* How to measure information
* How to compress information
* How to communicate securely over an insecure channel
There is a non-zero probability that the transmitted message is
different from the received message.

/Information theory/ is concerned with the theoretical limitations and
potentials of systems, and the best error-correcting performance we
could achieve.

/Coding theory/ is concerned with the creation of practical encoding
and decoding systems.
** Error-correcting codes for the binary symmetric channel
*** Repetition Codes
- Repeat every bit of the message a prearranged number of times. Take
  the bit that has the majority vote.
*** Block Codes - the (7, 4) Hamming Code
- Add redundancy to blocks of data instead of encoding one bit at a time
- A block code is a rule for converting a sequence of source bits =s=,
  of length =K=, into a transmitted sequence =t= of length =N= bits.
  - In a linear block code, the extra =N - K= bits are linear
    functions of the original =K= bits, and are called /parity-check/
    bits.

Because the Hamming code is a linear code, it can be written compactly
in terms of matrices:

\begin{equation*}
  \text{transmitted} = G^T \text{source}
\end{equation*}

where $G$ is the generator matrix of the code.

Syndrome decoding for the Hamming code involves checking the parity bits.
