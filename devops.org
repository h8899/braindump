** Features of a COE
1. clustering
2. scheduling
3. scaling
4. load balancing (pets to cattle)
   - monitoring services vs monitoring
5. fault tolerance
6. app deployment
** Why use kubernetes
1. google
2. battle hardened
3. features
4. open source
** Downsides to kubernetes
1. complex
2. zero to dev
3. non-native

| Feature                 | Concept                               |
|-------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| Colocation              | Pods                                  |
| Scaling/Fault Tolerance | Replication controllers, replica sets |
| Load Balancing          | Services                              |
| App Deployment          | Rolling-updates                       |
** Architecture
kubectl <--- scheduler (which node is used for container launch etc.)
             api server
             controllers manager (replication controller etc.)
             etcd (service discovery)

             MASTER

** Replication controller vs set
| Controller                 | Set                           |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| old way                    | new way                       |
| works with rolling updates | supports sets based selectors |
| imperative                 | part of deployments           |
|                            | declarative                   |

** Selectors
eg. I want to select these pods, add it to replication sets

** Kubernetes Schema
| Api Version | v1                               |   
| Kind        | Pod/ReplicaSet/ReplicaController |
| Metadata    | name/labels                      |
| Spec        | Containers                       |
