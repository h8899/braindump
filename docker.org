* Why Containers
[[file:images/docker/cargo.jpg]]
** Why Containers
#+ATTR_HTML: :class build fade
- Containers are cheap
- Containers are portable
- Containers are secure
- Containers greatly increase developer productivity
  - Development environment exactly the same as production
  - Much quicker to start than VMs
* Containers in OSes

| 2006 | Process Containers, later renamed to cgroups                   |
| 2008 | LXC: implemented using cgroups and kernel namespaces           |
| 2013 | Docker: initially built on LXC, but now runs on =libcontainer= |

** Pulling images
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker pull alpine
#+END_SRC
*** Alpine?
=alpine= is an image for a tiny Linux distribution, used by Docker for
most of its official images.

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of
a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code,
runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

=alpine= is pulled from the Docker Registry, where hundreds of
thousands of images are hosted.
** Starting a container
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run alpine
#+END_SRC

What is happening here?
** Running a command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run alpine echo "Hello from alpine!"
#+END_SRC
** Docker Status
List all docker images:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker images
#+END_SRC

List all running docker containers:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker ps
#+END_SRC

List all docker containers (including stopped containers):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker ps -a
#+END_SRC
** Entering a container interactively
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -it alpine sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  uname -r                        # 4.9.41-moby
  whoami                          # root
  id                              # uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin)...
#+END_SRC
* Docker Networking
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -p 5001:8080 alpine \
         nc -ll -p 8080 -e /bin/echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nHello World\n"
#+END_SRC

As a daemon:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -p 5001:8080 -d alpine \
         nc -ll -p 8080 -e /bin/echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nHello World\n"
#+END_SRC

* What is Docker?
Docker is software tool chain for managing LXC containers. Docker
containers have an API that allow for external adminstration of the
containers.

Containers virtualize at the operating system level, Hypervisors
virtualize at the hardware level.

Hypervisors abstract the operating system from hardware, containers
abstract the application from the operation system.

Hypervisors consumes storage space for each instance. Containers use a
single storage space plus smaller deltas for each layer and thus are
much more efficient.

Containers can boot and be application-ready in less than 500ms and
creates new designs opportunities for rapid scaling. Hypervisors boot
according to the OS typically 20 seconds, depending on storage speed.

Containers have built-in and high value APIs for cloud orchestration.
Hypervisors have lower quality APIs that have limited cloud
orchestration value.

#+RESULTS:
* Docker Storage Drivers
When you start a container, a thin writable container layer is added
on top of the other layers. Any changes the container makes to the
filesystem are stored here. Any files the container does not change do
not get copied to this writable layer. This means that the writable
layer is as small as possible.

When an existing file in a container is modified, the storage driver
performs a copy-on-write operation.

A data volume is a directory or file in the Docker hostâ€™s filesystem
that is mounted directly into a container. Data volumes are not
controlled by the storage driver. Reads and writes to data volumes
bypass the storage driver and operate at native host speeds. You can
mount any number of data volumes into a container. Multiple containers
can also share one or more data volumes.
