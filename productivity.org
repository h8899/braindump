* Getting Things Done (GTD)
* Zeigarnik Effect
Interrupted tasks are better remembered than completed ones
- Stop coding halfway while having a good streak, and come back another day
* Work Clean (Mise-en-place)
** Preparation
1. Always turn up early, greet the day
2. Calculate Meeze point
   - Optimal number of Actions done per day
** Process
1. Optimize the workplace:
   - Put pens etc near dominant hand, not so important things within
     arms reach. This is to prevent hands from crossing over, reducing friction.
   - Think about all the pain points, and think about how to automate
     them.
   - Make checklists for recurring tasks. Checklists are immutable,
     unlike task lists.
2. Difference between immersive time and process time
   - The first minutes matter more than the last
   - process time sometimes has more value
   - Assign a block of 30min in the morning for process time, then
     alternate between immersive and process time
3. Clean as you go
   - Remove distractions from workplace
   - Close emails etc as you go
   - Email mark and sweep process:
     1. Look through once, flagging and marking all as read
     2. Revisit flagged ones, take action if any
     3. Unflag when done
4. Slow down to move faster
   - Deliberately slow down to access quality velocity
   - Maintain some forward momentum
5. Aim to finish/keep the finish in mind
   - Do effort estimates, and try to keep tasks small, so that they're
     completable in shorter bursts
   - Clock in time, take deliberate breaks in between, weigh the value
     of a pause in between work
