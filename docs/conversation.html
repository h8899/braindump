<h1 class="title">Conversation</h1>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>The Flooding Smile</dt><dd>Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet
someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight
would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s
face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big,
warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into
your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The
split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is
genuine and only for them.</dd>
<dt>Sticky Eyes</dt><dd>Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation
partner’s with sticky warm taffy. Don’t break eye
contact even after he or she has finished speaking.
When you must look away, do it ever so slowly,
reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the
tiny string finally breaks.</dd>
<dt>Epoxy Eyes</dt><dd>This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch
your target person even when someone else is talking.
No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or
woman you want to impact.</dd>
<dt>Hang by Your Teeth</dt><dd>Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from
the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with
it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the
big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched
into perfect posture position.</dd>
<dt>The Big-Baby Pivot</dt><dd>Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The
instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new
acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the
undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to
your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big
toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts
“I think you are very, very special.”</dd>
<dt>Hello Old Friend</dt><dd>When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an
old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you
had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore
you two asunder. But, holy mackerel, now the party (the meeting,
the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend!
The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your
body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the
positioning of your toes—and everything between.</dd>
<dt>Limit the Fidget</dt><dd>Whenever your conversation really counts, let
your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not
fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep
your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and
all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re
fibbing.</dd>
<dt>Hans’s Horse Sense</dt><dd>Make it a habit to get on a dual track while
talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your
listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves
accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will
say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got
horse sense.</dd>
<dt>Watch the Scene before You Make the Scene</dt><dd>Rehearse being the
Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking
around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling
the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR yourself
chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing
you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you.
VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens
automatically.</dd>
<dt>Make a Mood Match</dt><dd>Before opening your mouth, take a “voice
sample” of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take
a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your listener
looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring
people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and
voice tone, if only for a moment.</dd>
<dt>Prosaic with Passion</dt><dd>Worried about your first words? Fear not,
because 80 percent of your listener’s impression has nothing to
do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is
fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a
positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound
exciting.</dd>
<dt>Always Wear a Whatzit</dt><dd>Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or
carry something unusual to give people who find you the
delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to
approach. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your . . . what
IS that?”</dd>
<dt>Whoozat</dt><dd>Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by
nonpoliticians) meeting-people device ever contrived.
Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or
pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into
icebreakers.</dd>
<dt>Eavesdrop In</dt><dd>No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just
sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to
infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy
excuse and jump in with “Excuse me, I couldn’t help
but overhear. . . .” Will they be taken aback?
Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily.
Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!</dd>
<dt>Never the Naked City</dt><dd>Whenever someone asks you the inevitable,
“And where are you from?” never, ever, unfairly challenge their
powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging
facts about your hometown that conversational partners can
comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to
your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist.</dd>
<dt>Never the Naked Job</dt><dd>When asked the inevitable “And what do you
do,” you may think “I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer” is
giving enough information to engender good conversation. However,
to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you
might as well be saying “I’m a
paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.” Flesh it out. Throw
out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to
munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring
the snacks back at the cheese tray.</dd>
<dt>Never the Naked Introduction</dt><dd>When introducing people, don’t throw
out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam,
leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic.
Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things.
Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking
opportunity.</dd>
<dt>Be a Word Detective</dt><dd>Like a good gumshoe, listen to your
conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her
preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring
on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like
Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for
the other person.</dd>
<dt>The Swiveling Spotlight</dt><dd>When you meet someone, imagine a giant
revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the
spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s
shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the
stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a
word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from
you, the more interesting he or she finds you.</dd>
<dt>Parroting</dt><dd>Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply
repeat the last few words your conversation partner
says. That puts the ball right back in his or her
court, and then all you need to do is listen.</dd>
<dt>Encore!</dt><dd>The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of
the applause is “Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!”
The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear
from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people
is “Tell them about the time you . . .” Whenever you’re
at a meeting or party with someone important to you,
think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an
appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will
enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat
performance.</dd>
<dt>Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive</dt><dd>When first meeting someone, lock
your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your
new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh,
and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s
the time, as the old song says, to “ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive
and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.”</dd>
<dt>The Latest News . . . Don’t Leave Home without It</dt><dd>The last move
to make before leaving for the party — even after you’ve given
yourself final approval in the mirror—is to turn on the radio
news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good
material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a
defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your
mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is
not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by
egg-on-face.</dd>
<dt>What Do You Do—NOT!</dt><dd>A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the
conspicuous absence of the question, “What do you do?” (You
determine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words
that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber,
a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never
strolled along Easy Street.)</dd>
<dt>The Nutshell Résumé</dt><dd>Just as job-seeking top managers roll a
different written résumé off their printers for each position
they’re applying for, let a different true story about your
professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before
responding to “What do you do?” ask yourself, “What possible
interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer
business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my
buddy?” Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to
work into your communications bag of tricks.</dd>
<dt>Your Personal Thesaurus</dt><dd>Look up some common words you use every
day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new
pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how
they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements.
Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich,
creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one.
Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the
verbally elite.</dd>
<dt>Kill the Quick “Me, Too!”</dt><dd>Whenever you have something in common
with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved
(and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big
cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with
a stranger. P.S.: Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared
interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky</dd>
<dt>Comm-YOU-nication</dt><dd>Start every appropriate sentence with you. It
immediately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more
positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves
them having to translate it into “me” terms. When you sprinkle
you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation,
your listeners find it an irresistible spice.</dd>
<dt>The Exclusive Smile</dt><dd>If you flash everybody the same smile, like a
Confederate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of
people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow
out of the beauty big players find in each new face. If one
person in a group is more important to you than the others,
reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.</dd>
<dt>Don’t Touch a Cliché with a Ten-Foot Pole</dt><dd>Be on guard. Don’t use
any clichés when chatting with big winners. Don’t even touch one
with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not
unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob. Instead of coughing
up a cliché, roll your own clever phrases by using the next
technique.</dd>
<dt>Use Jawsmith’s Jive</dt><dd>Whether you’re standing behind a podium
facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family,
you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read
speakers’ books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and
get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let
casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want
to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make ’em rhyme, make
’em clever, or make ’em funny. Above all, make ’em relevant.</dd>
<dt>Call a Spade a Spade</dt><dd>Don’t hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a
spade. That doesn’t mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words
when perfectly decent five- and six-letter ones exist. They’ve
simply learned the King’s English, and they speak it. Here’s
another way to tell the big players from the little ones just by
listening to a few minutes of their conversation.</dd>
<dt>Trash the Teasing</dt><dd>A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her
proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else’s expense
may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have
the last one. Because you’ll bang your head against the glass
ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their
paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll
wind up paying for it, dearly.</dd>
<dt>It’s the Receiver’s Ball</dt><dd>A football player wouldn’t last two
beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the
ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any
news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a
sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but
how the receiver will take it.</dd>
<dt>The Broken Record</dt><dd>Whenever someone persists in questioning you on
an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use
precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice.
Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude
interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never
fails to flick them off.</dd>
<dt>Big Shots Don’t Slobber</dt><dd>People who are VIPs in their own right
don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one,
don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or
insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the
star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory
that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a
drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the
conversation.</dd>
<dt>Never the Naked Thank You</dt><dd>Never let the phrase “thank you” stand
alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from “Thank you
for asking” to “Thank you for zipping me up.”</dd>
<dt>Scramble Therapy</dt><dd>Once a month, scramble your life. Do something
you’d never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an
exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your
experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider
questions from just one exposure.</dd>
<dt>Learn a Little Jobbledygook</dt><dd>Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a
second language. What is Jobbledygook? It’s the language of other
professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider.
How do you learn it? You’ll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the
language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick
up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you’ll
be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few
and the rewards are manifold.</dd>
<dt>Baring Their Hot Button</dt><dd>Before jumping blindly into a bevy of
bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues
are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the
outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the
industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those
buttons.</dd>
<dt>Read Their Rags</dt><dd>Is your next big client a golfer, runner,
swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function
filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists—or anything in between?
There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every
imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you’ll
ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading
the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy
of Zoonooz yet?)</dd>
<dt>Clear “Customs”</dt><dd>Before putting one toe on foreign soil, get a
book on dos and taboos around the world. Before you shake hands,
give a gift, make gestures, or even compliment anyone’s
possessions, check it out. Your gaffe could gum up your entire
gig.</dd>
<dt>Bluffing for Bargains</dt><dd>The haggling skills used in ancient Arab
markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket
items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before
every big purchase, find several vendors—a few to learn from and
one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you’re
ready to head for the store where you’re going to buy.</dd>
<dt>Be a Copyclass</dt><dd>Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small
movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky?
Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the
person you are talking to is your dance
instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic
mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the
style of movement. That makes your conversation
partner subliminally real comfy with you.</dd>
<dt>Echoing</dt><dd>Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a
powerful wallop. Listen to the speaker’s arbitrary choice
of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives—and echo them
back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates
subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their
values, their attitudes, their interests, their
experiences.</dd>
<dt>Potent Imaging</dt><dd>Does your customer have a garden? Talk about
“sowing the seeds for success.” Does your boss own
a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will
“hold water” or “stay afloat.” Maybe he is a
private pilot? Talk about a concept really “taking
off.” She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits
the “sweet spot.” Evoke your listener’s interests
or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give
your points more power and punch, use analogies
from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent
Imaging also tells your listeners you think like
them and hints you share their interests.</dd>
<dt>Employ Empathizers</dt><dd>Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize
complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue
with phrases like “I see what you mean.” Sprinkle it with
sentimental sparklers like “That’s a lovely thing to say.” Your
empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue.</dd>
<dt>Anatomically Correct Empathizers</dt><dd>What part of their anatomy are
your associates talking through? Their eyes? Their ears? Their
gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think
you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use
auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and
clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make
them think you feel the same way they do.</dd>
<dt>The Premature WE</dt><dd>Create the sensation of intimacy with someone
even if you’ve met just moments before. Scramble the signals in
their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and
cutting right to levels three and four. Elicit intimate feelings
by using the magic words we, us, and our.</dd>
<dt>Instant History</dt><dd>When you meet a stranger you’d like to make less
a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your
first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh,
the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just
like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant
History. With anyone you’d like to make part of your personal or
professional future, look for special moments together. Then make
them a refrain.</dd>
<dt>Grapevine Glory</dt><dd>A compliment one hears is never as exciting as
the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by
telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you
escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing,
bootlicking, egg-sucking, backscratching sycophant trying to win
brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy
that you are telling the whole world about their greatness.</dd>
<dt>Carrier Pigeon Kudos</dt><dd>People immediately grow a beak and
metamorphosize themselves into carrier pigeons when there’s bad
news. (It’s called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good
news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about
someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not
posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like
Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the carrier pigeon of kind
thoughts.</dd>
